# FibonicaGenerator

## Program Description

The `FibonicaaGenerator` program is designed to generate prime numbers up to a specified limit. This program is a demonstration of key programming activities, including class creation, list comprehensions, error handling, and logging.

### Features

- Class-based Design: Encapsulates the prime number generation logic within a `PrimeNumberGenerator` class.
- Input Validation: Ensures the provided limit is a valid integer greater than 1.
- Efficient Prime Calculation: Uses list comprehensions and basic mathematical checks to generate prime numbers.
- Error Handling: Manages invalid inputs and unexpected errors gracefully.
- Logging: Records the program's operations and any errors in a log file named `prime_generator.log`.
